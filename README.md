### Group Project Proposal
- Personal Media Tracker.
  - Create custom lists to track any hobby/media (movies, TV shows, books, recipes, pokemon cards)
  - Public viewing and sharing. Lists can be public or private. you can specifically share a list but also mark certain entries as private and they wont be shared.
  - Track what movies you've seen and if you liked them, and share recommendations.
  - Looking into watching a movie? Cross-reference it with what your friends thought about it.
  - Common lists (Movies, Books, Etc..) and custume lists or interests (pokemon cards, shell collection, tea kettle collection)
