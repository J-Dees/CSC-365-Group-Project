### Group Project Proposal
- Personal Media Tracker.
  - Create custom lists to track any hobby/media (movies, TV shows, books, recipes, pokemon cards)
  - Public viewing and sharing. Lists can be public, private, or friends only. These access specifiers are for entire lists or specific entries.
  - Share recommendations and track what movies you've seen, if you liked them, and when you saw them.
  - Looking into watching a movie? Cross-reference it with what your friends thought about it. No more trusting bribed critiques with poor taste.
  - Common lists (Movies, Books, Etc..) and custom lists or interests (pokemon cards, shell collection, tea kettle collection)
