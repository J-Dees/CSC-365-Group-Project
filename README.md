### Constraints: Need 12 potential users/test cases, 12 exception handling

- Health Tracker App (calorie intake, nutrient deficiency)
  - Track calories and macronutrients.
  - Could interface with a database of common food items and their nutritional information or directly input nutritional information.
  - Would be able to input exercises and activities to better calculate nutritional needs.
  - Choose preset diets such as kito or bulking or cutting for working out or health reasons. Adjacent to this would be adding allergy considerations.  
  - Would give tips and warnings describing nutrient deficiencies and possible fixes.
  
- Personal Media Tracker.
  - Create custom lists to track any hobby/media (movies, TV shows, books, recipes, pokemon cards)
  - Public viewing and sharing. Lists can be public or private. you can specifically share a list but also mark certain entries as private and they wont be shared.
  - Track what movies you've seen and if you liked them, and share recommendations.
  - Looking into watching a movie? Cross-reference it with what your friends thought about it.
  - Common lists (Movies, Books, Etc..) and custume lists or interests (pokemon cards, shell collection, tea kettle collection)



- Idea 2: Some sort of schedule planner/booker (school, business)
  - Day-by-day schedules with repeated events and one-time events.
  - Have to-do lists allow the creation of multiple daily tasks, monthly tasks, and random side projects.
  - Reminder notifications?
- Idea 3: Some sort of networking app (contact manager or social media app)
