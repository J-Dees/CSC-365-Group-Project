### Constraints: Need 12 potential users/test cases, 12 exception handling

- Idea 1: Health Tracker App (calorie intake, nutrient deficiency)
    -track calories and macronutrients.
    -could possibly interface with a database of common food items.
    -Could consider time gaps and exercise to calculate caloric/nutrient needs. 
- Idea 2: Some sort of schedule planner/booker (school, business)
    -Day-by-day schedules with repeated events and one-time events.
    -Have to-do lists allow the creation of multiple daily tasks, monthly tasks, and random side projects.
    -Reminder notifications?
- Idea 3: Some sort of networking app (contact manager or social media app)
